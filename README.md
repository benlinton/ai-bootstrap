# AI Bootstrap

Copy `ai-bootstrap` into to any project for a streamlined AI-based workflow.  Modify per project.

- Document before you code. Your PRD.md becomes the source of truth for every AI conversation and each granular feature.
- Use reference modules to load only what's relevant
- If you don something more than a few times, make it a command
- Rest context. Planning and execution should be separate conversations.
  - Research, design, create planning doc. Capture all context.
  - Clear converstaion with a fresh start
  - Implement the next feature
